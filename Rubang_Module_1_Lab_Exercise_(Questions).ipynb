A Greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective function is optimized.

The only problem with them is that you might come up with the correct solution but you might not be able to verify if its the correct one. All the greedy problems share a common property that a local optima can eventually lead to a global minima without reconsidering the set of choices already considered.\n",
